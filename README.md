# Hangul Bubble
Hangul Bubble is a simple yet fun mobile learning game designed to help players practice Korean characters (Hangul) in an interactive way.
The player is presented with an English word and must pop the bubbles containing Korean letters to form the correct translation.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- Players pop bubbles containing Korean characters to form the correct Hangul equivalent of an English word.

- Includes three difficulty levels:

  - 🟢 Easy

  - 🟡 Medium

  - 🔴 Hard

- Each level limits the number of available hints.

- A hint button appears when the user gets the word wrong to provide additional help.

- Features background music, sound effects, and confetti particles to enhance the experience.

## 🧠 Motivation

Originally, I wanted to make a small game using Unity6 and in celebration of Hangul Day, but as I continued developing, I added more elements—UI polish, effects, and difficulty levels—until it evolved into a full project.
I also plan to expand it in the future with an AR mode for an even more immersive experience.
